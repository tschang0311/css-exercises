/* Chaining selector selects an element with both as the 1st class and first as the 2nd class */
/* This is also how to make comments in css code */

/* Again, chaining selector selects an element with both as the 1st class and second as the 2nd class */
/* Another selector that could be used in simply the grouping selector, this would have reduced the number of 
classes that each element needs. Grouping would be used to add the properties shared by both elements */
